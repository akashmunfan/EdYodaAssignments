First Approach
We first will examine that on the port any service is active or not.
If it is active then we will access the YAML file and change the port.
Second Approach
We will delete all the pods and services related to that set.
And will apply kubectl and that YAML file.

In this case we will use rolling update.
It is the gradual process that allows to update application with some changes and no downtime.
The previous pod is taken down and the updated one is deployed.
The newly deployed application will have next version than previous application



Following part will be needed to add in yaml file under spec



minReadySeconds: 5
strategy:
type: RollingUpdate
rollingUpdate:
maxSurge: 1
maxUnavailable: 1



Example
command for rolling update --> kubectl set image deployment nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.14.2 --record
